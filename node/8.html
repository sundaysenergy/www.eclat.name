                  Inspiring:<br />
                  <br />
                  Waltzing in--a confident stride<br />
                  Pressed, yet rumpled just enough<br />
                  Royalty shrouded by a common man<br />
                  Grand smile<br />
                  Generosity falls forth<br />
                  As he breaks the ice of strangers<br />
                  Quietly his quill begins to bend<br />
                  Framing each in softer light<br />
                  Second chair is fine with him<br />
                  Humility falling on drunkards<br />
                  Where is <em>his </em>need?<br />
                  Perhaps it's in the granting...<br />
