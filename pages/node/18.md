Andy  
  
Appears  
to throw  
firecrackers...  
  
While,  
actually,  
he hurls  
a net.

High noon.  
  
The townspeople scatter.  
  
A horse whinnies,  
then all is silent.  
  
The law is here.  
  
Helen steps into the street.

The cookware  
is not as important  
as the ingredients...  
  
Even the  
particular ingredients

what matters most  
is if the recipe  
surprises!

Stas & Annie  
  
The mystic  
and the skeptic  
  
The waterfall  
and the pool  
  
Oh! My dear,  
the gravity  
of you

Natalie waits...  
  
a snare  
     whipping her skyward?  
a stairway  
     steadily taking her up?  
a seance  
     slowly levitating her?  
  
Natalie waits...
