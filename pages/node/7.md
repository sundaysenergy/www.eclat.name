Éclat draws his inspiration from the artist, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.  
  
As a youth, Éclat traveled to see a special exhibition: twelve rooms   
filled with drawings and paintings by Toulouse-Lautrec.  
  
Much more intimate than the mass-produced Moulin-Rouge posters,   
each piece depicted a person or group.  
  
No still-lifes or landscapes. Only personalities.  
  
Toulouse-Lautrec's work made art celebratory for Éclat.  
  
So inspired, Éclat, aka Mark Lynch,   
now offers drawings of personalities...with words.
