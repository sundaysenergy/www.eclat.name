The horizon  
does not seem  
big enough,  
the Earth  
deep enough,  
the sky  
high enough...  
  
For Ray's heart.

One day,  
when he manages  
to drill clear through the Earth  
exiting China's crust  
and by sheer momentum  
shoot into space  
and, accelerating  
past our gravity,  
hit another planet

call to report.

*Lolo  
drives a speedboat  
in an auto race...  
ties herself   
to a tree in a tornado...  
lies in a garden  
to listen to the flowers...  
  
Why?  
Ask Lolo.

he launches   
them back  
as one.

Rieky  
says she's *trouble...!*  
  
Rieky's Mother  
says she's a *saint...!  
*  
Ricky is, in fact,  
a human being.  
  
In other words,  
*a trouble-making saint...!

Planting season  
or worry?  
  
When  
you bloom  
you'll know  
the answer.
