Inspiring:  
  
Waltzing in--a confident stride  
Pressed, yet rumpled just enough  
Royalty shrouded by a common man  
Grand smile  
Generosity falls forth  
As he breaks the ice of strangers  
Quietly his quill begins to bend  
Framing each in softer light  
Second chair is fine with him  
Humility falling on drunkards  
Where is *his *need?  
Perhaps it's in the granting...  
  
Vanessa, Poem Subject
