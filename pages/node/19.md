Éclat entertains at events,  
writing caricatures for party guests.  
  
Éclat draws personalities...with words:  
  
  
One smiling eye  
skimming the surface  
like a periscope.  
  
The other,  
frantic,  
seaching the ocean floor  
for scraps.  
  
You   
are the point  
of convergence,  
as I try to build  
a boat that floats.
