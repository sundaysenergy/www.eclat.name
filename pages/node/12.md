A leaf falling  
to the forest floor  
floats  
not as gently  
as  
Noema's  
murmur.

Cain  
would teach you  
Kung Fu…

Will Rogers  
could teach you to  
joke and lasso…

Yoda  
should teach you to  
feel the Force…  
  
All three?  
Hervé,  
of course.

The Hubble  
Space Telescope…  
  
Perhaps, even God  
on a bad day…  
  
See not as far  
as Gerald.

The ship may be sinking, but...  
  
Laura wrangles

lifeboat.  
  
Then finds a way   
to keep the   
ship afloat.

Riley the surgeon...  


effortlessly  
reaches  
inside you  
and  
extracts  
a laugh.

Lyla  
sidearms the stone…  
  
Rex  
is the lake…  
  
Sometimes  
there are waves…  
  
But somehow  
the stone  
still skips…
