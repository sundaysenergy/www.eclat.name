The lake  
must be perfectly still...  
  
and if you can see  
every star reflected...  
  
then you'll know...  
  
how many times

Could a paper boat,  
in the spring rise,  
be more delicate?  
  
Or a crape streamer  
in the wind,  
however colorful,  
more vulnerable?  
  
If honey bees  
made art,  
they'd make  
Sophie.

Combine  
just a pinch  
of self-effacement...

that   
come-hither  
look...  
  
But if the  
recipe  
possesses   
no complexity...  
  
Kim  
won't  
cook.

Ed's Haiku  
  
  
Spring steel sculptured man.  
Water lapping on the shore.  
Wow! He does not rust!
