Mark Lynch drew his inspiration for Éclat from the artist, Tolouse-Lautrec.

As a youth, Mark's father traveled with him to an exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago: twelve rooms of paintings and drawings by Henri de Tolouse-Lautrec. Much more intimate than the mass-produced Moulin-Rouge posters, each piece depicted a person or group. 

  
Toulouse-Lautrec's work made art celebratory for Mark.  
  
No still-lifes or landscapes. Only personalities. 
Mark Lynch, utilizing the pseudonym Éclat, and inspired by the art of Toulouse-Lautrec, now offers drawings of personalities…with words.
