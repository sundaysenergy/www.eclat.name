				The discreet and charming &Eacute;clat engages your guests<br>
			as a caricaturist would&#x2026;<br>
			<br>
			But instead of drawing a portrait,<br>
			&Eacute;clat composes an original poem about the guest's personality&#x2026;<br>
			<br>
			And immediately offers the guest their poem,<br>
			printed and presented to them in &Eacute;clat's custom booklet,<br>
			suitable for framing&#x2026;<br>
			<br>
			&Eacute;clat continues this process with each guest in succession:<br>
			composing, printing and giving each guest their own original poem&#x2026;<br>
